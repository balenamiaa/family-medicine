This means breast milk is the sole source of nutrition and hydration.\n\n### Correct Answer Explained\nThe recommendation is to breastfeed as often as the child wants (on demand), both day and night, amounting to at least **8 times in 24 hours**. No other foods or fluids (including water) should be given before 6 months.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- **Cereals at 4 months:** Complementary feeding should start at **6 months**. Early introduction increases the risk of infection and allergies.\n- **Water:** Breast milk contains sufficient water even in hot climates. Supplementing water can introduce pathogens and decrease the infant's intake of nutrient-rich breast milk.\n- **Fruit juices:** Not recommended for infants under 1 year (and definitely not under 6 months) as they displace breast milk and offer no nutritional advantage."

It indicates insulin resistance or relative insulin deficiency without complete metabolic decompensation. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) specifically reflects hepatic insulin resistance affecting overnight glucose production, while impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) reflects peripheral insulin resistance affecting postprandial glucose disposal.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nThe patient's fasting plasma glucose of 118 mg/dL falls within the IFG range of 100-125 mg/dL according to ADA criteria. Two separate measurements confirm this is not a laboratory error. She has multiple risk factors (obesity, family history) making this finding clinically significant.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Normal glucose tolerance: Requires FPG <100 mg/dL; her value of 118 mg/dL exceeds this threshold\n- Diabetes mellitus: Requires FPG ≥126 mg/dL on two occasions; 118 mg/dL does not meet this criterion\n- Impaired glucose tolerance: This diagnosis requires an OGTT with 2-hour glucose of 140-199 mg/dL; it cannot be diagnosed by FPG alone\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nRecommend therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) as first-line intervention.

Lifestyle modification can reduce diabetes risk by 50% or more.\n\n**Variations & Exam Traps:**\nIf the question had shown FPG of 126 mg/dL on one occasion only, the answer would still not be diabetes (requires two occasions or symptoms + random glucose ≥200).

Beyond glycemic control, they provide cardioprotective and renoprotective benefits independent of glucose lowering through mechanisms including reduced preload, decreased blood pressure, improved cardiac energetics, and reduced inflammation.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nEmpagliflozin (an SGLT-2 inhibitor) is the ideal choice because it provides dual benefits: glycemic control AND proven reduction in heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular death (EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial). It is specifically indicated in patients with heart failure regardless of diabetes status.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Glibenclamide: This sulfonylurea increases insulin secretion but carries risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. Among sulfonylureas, glibenclamide specifically has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk and should be avoided in heart failure\n- Pioglitazone: Thiazolidinediones cause fluid retention and are CONTRAINDICATED in heart failure (NYHA Class III-IV). They increase edema and can precipitate or worsen heart failure\n- Sitagliptin: DPP-4 inhibitors are weight-neutral and have modest efficacy but are NOT cardioprotective and provide no heart failure benefit. Some (saxagliptin) may even increase HF hospitalizations\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nMonitor for SGLT-2 inhibitor side effects including genital mycotic infections, UTIs, and euglycemic DKA. Ensure adequate hydration. Check renal function periodically.\n\n**Variations & Exam Traps:**\nIf the patient had chronic kidney disease with eGFR <30, SGLT-2 inhibitors would have limited glucose-lowering efficacy but may still provide cardio-renal protection. GLP-1 agonists are another excellent choice for CV protection but don't have the same HF mortality benefit."

The key screening marker is urinary albumin (microalbuminuria or albumin-to-creatinine ratio). Type 2 diabetes often exists for years before clinical diagnosis, meaning nephropathy may already be present at diagnosis.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nIn type 2 diabetes, screening for nephropathy should begin at the time of diagnosis because the disease typically has an insidious onset and may have been present for many years before detection. Up to 7% of patients with newly diagnosed T2DM already have microalbuminuria.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- 5 years after diagnosis: This timing applies to TYPE 1 diabetes, where the onset is acute and well-defined\n- 10 years after diagnosis: Too late for either type; nephropathy may be advanced by then\n- When symptoms appear: Diabetic nephropathy is asymptomatic in early stages; waiting for symptoms means missing the window for intervention\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nScreen using urinary albumin excretion or albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Treatment of early nephropathy includes tight glycemic control, BP control (<140/90), and ACE inhibitors or ARBs (even without HTN). Annual screening thereafter.\n\n**Variations & Exam Traps:**\nFor retinopathy screening, the same principle applies: T2DM at diagnosis, T1DM after 5 years.

Current FDA guidelines allow metformin use with dose adjustment based on eGFR: contraindicated if eGFR <30, dose reduction if eGFR 30-45, and reassessment if eGFR 45-60.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nWith an eGFR of 42 mL/min/1.73m² (CKD Stage 3b), metformin should be dose-reduced rather than discontinued. The maximum recommended dose at this GFR level is typically 1000 mg daily (reduced from his current 2000 mg). Close monitoring of renal function is essential.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Immediately discontinued: Discontinuation is warranted at eGFR <30, not 42.

Early detection of problems prevents amputation.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Only when symptoms develop: Neuropathy causes loss of protective sensation, so patients may not feel injuries.

Severely elevated HbA1c (≥9%) or FPG (≥300 mg/dL) indicates significant insulin deficiency or resistance that monotherapy is unlikely to control. Early intensive therapy achieves better long-term glycemic control through 'metabolic memory.'\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nWith HbA1c 9.2% and FPG 245 mg/dL, this patient has severe hyperglycemia requiring combination therapy from the outset. Guidelines recommend starting metformin plus a second agent (or insulin if symptomatic/catabolic). Delaying intensification allows glucotoxicity to worsen beta-cell function.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Lifestyle modification alone: Only appropriate for mild hyperglycemia (HbA1c <7% or close to target). Would be inadequate here\n- Metformin monotherapy: Monotherapy is first-line for HbA1c <9%. With his severe hyperglycemia, monotherapy would take months to achieve control, exposing him to prolonged hyperglycemic complications\n- Insulin only: While insulin is an option, combination with metformin is preferred unless contraindicated, as metformin provides additional benefits (weight neutrality, cardiovascular protection)\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nOptions for combination include metformin plus: SGLT-2 inhibitor (if CVD/HF/CKD), GLP-1 agonist (if obesity/CVD), or insulin (if catabolic symptoms). Reassess HbA1c in 3 months.\n\n**Variations & Exam Traps:**\nIf the patient presented with weight loss, polyuria, and polydipsia (catabolic symptoms), insulin would be preferred initially. If HbA1c were 7.5%, metformin monotherapy would be appropriate."

            "explanation": "**Core Concept & Mechanism:**\nSulfonylureas stimulate insulin secretion by binding to SUR1 receptors on pancreatic beta cells, closing K-ATP channels, and depolarizing the cell. Glibenclamide (glyburide) has the longest half-life among sulfonylureas and produces active metabolites that accumulate, especially in renal impairment. This causes prolonged, severe hypoglycemia.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nGlibenclamide's long half-life (10-16 hours) combined with active metabolites makes hypoglycemia episodes prolonged and difficult to treat. Patients may require hospital admission for glucose monitoring for 24-48 hours because recurrent hypoglycemia is common even after initial treatment.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Short duration of action: Glibenclamide has LONG duration, which is the problem. Short-acting secretagogues (repaglinide, nateglinide) cause less prolonged hypoglycemia\n- Minimal hepatic metabolism: Glibenclamide undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism to active metabolites that contribute to hypoglycemia\n- Renal-independent elimination: Glibenclamide metabolites are renally excreted, accumulating in renal impairment and worsening hypoglycemia risk\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nImmediate treatment: IV dextrose. Admit for observation due to risk of recurrent hypoglycemia. Consider switching to a safer sulfonylurea (glimepiride, gliclazide) or different class. Glibenclamide is also the only sulfonylurea associated with increased cardiovascular risk.\n\n**Variations & Exam Traps:**\nMeglitinides (repaglinide, nateglinide) are 'rapid-onset, short-acting' alternatives with lower hypoglycemia risk - useful for postprandial control and irregular meal patterns."

They redistribute fat from visceral to subcutaneous depots and improve adiponectin levels. However, they also cause fluid retention through renal sodium reabsorption.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nTZDs work by activating PPAR-gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) nuclear receptors, primarily in adipocytes. This increases insulin sensitivity and improves glucose uptake. They also have anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Safe in NYHA Class III-IV HF: TZDs are CONTRAINDICATED in symptomatic heart failure (NYHA III-IV) due to fluid retention that can precipitate or worsen HF\n- First-line after metformin: Not first-line due to side effects (edema, weight gain, fractures, bladder cancer concern). SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists are preferred second-line agents, especially with CVD\n- No effect on fluid retention: TZDs cause significant fluid retention, leading to peripheral edema and weight gain\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nTZDs can be useful for PCOS (improve ovulation) and have good hepatic safety.

Age extremes suggest secondary causes: young patients may have renal artery dysplasia, coarctation, or pheochromocytoma; older patients may have atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nOnset <30 years or >60 years is a red flag for secondary hypertension. Essential hypertension typically develops between ages 30-55 with gradual onset and family history. His age of 35 is borderline, but combined with absence of family history, investigation is warranted.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Obesity: Associated with essential hypertension (increased sympathetic activity, RAAS activation) - a risk factor but not a red flag for secondary HTN\n- Sedentary lifestyle: Contributing factor to essential HTN, not a marker of secondary causes\n- High sodium diet: Exacerbates essential HTN but doesn't suggest secondary cause\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nOther secondary HTN red flags: rapid renal deterioration after ACEi/ARB (renal artery stenosis), hypokalemia (hyperaldosteronism), episodic HTN with headache/palpitations (pheochromocytoma), abdominal bruit. 50% of secondary HTN is renal (renal parenchymal or renovascular).\n\n**Variations & Exam Traps:**\nDrugs causing HTN: NSAIDs, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, decongestants, cyclosporine, erythropoietin.

This provides renal protection beyond BP lowering. They slow progression of diabetic nephropathy even in normotensive patients with microalbuminuria.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line for hypertensive diabetics because they provide dual benefit: blood pressure control AND renoprotection. They reduce proteinuria and slow CKD progression, which is particularly important given diabetes is the leading cause of ESRD.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Beta-blocker: Can mask hypoglycemia symptoms, worsen glycemic control, and are not first-line for uncomplicated hypertension. Reserved for specific indications (CAD, HF, arrhythmias)\n- Thiazide diuretic: Can worsen glucose tolerance and cause hypokalemia.

            "explanation": "**Core Concept & Mechanism:**\nACE inhibitors prevent breakdown of bradykinin by inhibiting ACE (kininase II). Accumulated bradykinin stimulates sensory nerve endings in the airways, causing a dry, nonproductive cough in 5-20% of patients (more common in women and Asians). ARBs don't affect bradykinin metabolism.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nSwitching from ACEi to ARB is the appropriate management. ARBs provide similar cardiovascular and renal benefits without the bradykinin-related cough. The cough typically resolves within 1-4 weeks after discontinuation.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Reduce dose: ACEi cough is not dose-dependent. Reducing the dose won't eliminate the cough\n- Add cough suppressant: Doesn't address the underlying mechanism and adds unnecessary medication. The cough will persist\n- Stop antihypertensive therapy: Inappropriate - she needs BP control.

It is not related to fluid retention or heart failure.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nDihydropyridine CCBs cause ankle edema in up to 10-30% of patients (dose-dependent). Amlodipine and nifedipine are most commonly implicated. The edema is typically bilateral, pitting, and worsens with prolonged standing.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- ACE inhibitors: Cause cough, angioedema (lip/tongue swelling, not peripheral), hyperkalemia.

            "explanation": "**Core Concept & Mechanism:**\nIsolated systolic hypertension (ISH) occurs due to age-related arterial stiffening (arteriosclerosis). Loss of arterial compliance increases systolic pressure (peak of pulse wave) while diastolic remains normal or low. This increases pulse pressure, which is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events in the elderly.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nISH is more dangerous to elderly patients than diastolic hypertension. It significantly increases risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and mortality. Treatment reduces these risks substantially (SHEP, Syst-Eur trials).\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Little risk: FALSE - ISH carries substantial cardiovascular risk, equal to or greater than combined systolic-diastolic HTN\n- Does not increase stroke risk: FALSE - ISH is a major risk factor for stroke, particularly in the elderly\n- Should not be treated: FALSE - multiple trials demonstrate treatment benefit in older adults. Treat to SBP <150 mmHg initially, potentially <140 if tolerated\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nTreat ISH with lifestyle modification plus pharmacotherapy.

It emphasizes potassium, calcium, and magnesium (which promote vasodilation and natriuresis) while limiting sodium and saturated fat (which promote vasoconstriction and fluid retention). It can reduce SBP by 8-14 mmHg.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nThe DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is the evidence-based dietary intervention specifically developed for hypertension. Key components: high fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy; low saturated fat, red meat, sweets; sodium <2.4 g/day.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- High protein, low carbohydrate: Not specifically designed for HTN.

Not validated for HTN management; high fat content may have adverse effects\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nDASH diet components: fruits and vegetables (4-5 servings each/day), low-fat dairy (2-3 servings/day), lean meats, nuts, legumes. Sodium restriction to <2.4 g/day enhances effect.

Uterine atony (failure of myometrial contraction) is the most common cause (70-80%). The contracted uterus compresses spiral arteries at the placental site; without contraction, hemorrhage continues.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nThe 'soft and boggy' uterus on palpation is the classic finding of uterine atony. Risk factors include prolonged labor, overdistention (macrosomia, polyhydramnios, multiple gestation), high parity, and oxytocin use. Blood loss of 650 mL meets PPH criteria (>500 mL for vaginal delivery).\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Cervical laceration: Would present with continued bleeding despite a firm, contracted uterus.

Other absolute contraindications include active tuberculosis, chemotherapy, and abuse of certain drugs (cocaine, heroin, PCP).\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Hepatitis B: NOT a contraindication if the infant receives HBV vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin at birth. Breastfeeding is safe after immunoprophylaxis\n- Mastitis: Breastfeeding should CONTINUE during mastitis (helps resolution). Discontinuing increases abscess risk. Milk is safe for the infant\n- Inverted nipples: A mechanical challenge, not a contraindication. Nipple shields, breast pumps, and lactation support can help\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nOther contraindications: galactosemia in infant (cannot metabolize lactose), active herpes lesions on breast (can feed from unaffected breast), certain medications (antimetabolites, radioactive isotopes), active untreated varicella. Hepatitis C is NOT a contraindication unless nipples are cracked and bleeding.\n\n**Variations & Exam Traps:**\nWith proper antiretroviral therapy, HIV transmission through breastfeeding can be reduced to <1% - hence WHO recommends breastfeeding with ART in resource-limited settings.

Its caloric density is perfectly calibrated for infant growth and development.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nBreast milk provides approximately 65-75 kcal per 100 mL (or 20 kcal per ounce). This is relatively consistent across mothers, though hindmilk (end of feeding) has higher fat content than foremilk. Infant formula is designed to match this caloric density.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- 35-45 kcal: Too low - would result in inadequate caloric intake for infant growth\n- 100-120 kcal: Too high - this approaches the density of some concentrated formulas used for preterm infants\n- 150-200 kcal: Far too high - would provide excessive calories\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nBreast milk composition: Fats 3-5%, Protein 0.8-0.9%, Carbohydrates (lactose) 7%. Colostrum (first few days) is yellow, rich in IgA, proteins, and minerals. Mature milk transitions by 2 weeks. Benefits include ideal nutrition, passive immunity, bonding, and reduced allergies.\n\n**Variations & Exam Traps:**\nPreterm infants may need fortified breast milk (additional calories, protein, minerals).

Correct latch involves the infant taking the entire areola (not just nipple), with lips flanged outward and chin touching the breast. Poor latch causes friction trauma.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nManagement includes: ensuring proper latch-on technique, frequent position changes (alternating breasts), nipple shields if needed, keeping nipples clean and dry between feedings, and applying lanolin or expressed breast milk as a healing salve. Breastfeeding should continue.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Discontinue breastfeeding: Usually unnecessary and counterproductive. Continued emptying prevents engorgement and mastitis\n- Topical vitamin E: Should be AVOIDED due to risk of infant ingestion and potential toxicity. Also may cause contact dermatitis\n- Switch to formula: Overly drastic for a treatable problem. Would deny infant benefits of breastfeeding\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nRed flags requiring further evaluation: persistent pain despite correction (rule out thrush), fever/chills (mastitis), spreading erythema (abscess). Nipple shields can help temporarily but should not be long-term solution.

Additionally, combined hormonal contraceptives increase thromboembolic risk in the early postpartum period. Progestin-only methods are safe during breastfeeding and do not affect milk supply.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nThe progestin-only pill (POP/'mini-pill') is safe during breastfeeding. It does not decrease milk supply, has minimal transfer to breast milk, and can be started at any time postpartum. Other safe options: Depo-Provera (can start at 6 weeks), progestin IUD (can place at 6 weeks), copper IUD.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Combined oral contraceptives: Estrogen decreases milk production. Should avoid until breastfeeding well-established (typically 6 weeks for non-breastfeeding women, but recommend delay until 6 months for breastfeeding)\n- Estrogen patch: Same estrogen-related concerns as combined pills\n- Combined vaginal ring: Contains estrogen; same restrictions apply\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nNon-breastfeeding women: avoid combined hormonal contraceptives for first 3 weeks postpartum (thromboembolism risk). Lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) provides 98% contraception if: exclusive breastfeeding, amenorrheic, and <6 months postpartum - all three criteria required.\n\n**Variations & Exam Traps:**\nIUD (hormonal or copper) can be placed at 6-week visit.

The risk of Down syndrome increases from ~1:1,000 at age 25 to ~1:350 at age 35 and ~1:100 at age 40.

BMI >30 (obesity) or <18.5 (underweight) would be concerning\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nOther high-risk factors: Extremes of age (<18 or >35), grand multiparity (≥5), previous obstetric complications (preterm birth, stillbirth), medical conditions (DM, HTN, renal disease), obesity (BMI >30), short stature (<150 cm), multiple gestation, abnormal placentation.\n\n**Variations & Exam Traps:**\nVery young mothers (<18) also face increased risks (preeclampsia, anemia, preterm birth, low birth weight).

            "explanation": "**Core Concept & Mechanism:**\nDuring pregnancy, plasma volume increases by approximately 50% while red blood cell mass increases by only 20-30%. This disproportionate expansion creates hemodilution - a relative decrease in hemoglobin concentration despite increased total hemoglobin mass. This is physiological, not pathological anemia.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nThe 'anemia of pregnancy' is primarily due to hemodilution. Plasma volume expansion serves important functions: increased uteroplacental perfusion, meeting metabolic demands, and creating reserve for delivery blood loss. Hemoglobin typically drops by 1-2 g/dL.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Decreased RBC production: Actually, erythropoiesis is INCREASED during pregnancy (elevated erythropoietin)\n- Increased RBC destruction: Hemolysis does not occur in normal pregnancy.

The most common cause is retained placental tissue (retained products of conception - RPOC). Retained tissue prevents normal uterine involution and provides a focus for infection and continued bleeding.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nThe diagnosis is late/secondary postpartum hemorrhage, most likely due to retained placental tissue. Key clues: timing (10 days postpartum = late PPH), heavy bleeding with clots, enlarged tender uterus (failure to involute). Pelvic ultrasound is the confirmatory test to visualize echogenic material in the uterine cavity.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\nOther causes of late PPH include: endometritis (would have fever, purulent discharge), subinvolution of placental site, coagulopathy (less likely without history). However, the clinical picture points most strongly to retained tissue.\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nManagement: If RPOC confirmed, surgical evacuation (suction curettage) is indicated. Administer uterotonics (oxytocin, misoprostol), antibiotics (to cover infection). Monitor hemoglobin, transfuse if needed. Histopathology of evacuated tissue confirms retained products.\n\n**Variations & Exam Traps:**\nSubinvolution of the placental site (incomplete involution of spiral arteries) can also cause late PPH but typically shows normal-appearing uterine cavity on ultrasound.

            "explanation": "**Core Concept & Mechanism:**\nHypoglycemia triggers a counter-regulatory response mediated by catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine). These cause autonomic symptoms as early warning signs. If glucose continues to fall, brain glucose deprivation causes neuroglycopenic symptoms. Recognizing early autonomic symptoms allows self-treatment.\n\n**Correct Answer Explained:**\nSweating and tremor are classic autonomic (adrenergic) symptoms of hypoglycemia. These are mediated by sympathetic nervous system activation and typically occur at glucose levels 55-65 mg/dL, serving as early warning signs.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**\n- Confusion: Neuroglycopenic symptom (brain glucose deprivation), not autonomic\n- Seizures: Severe neuroglycopenic manifestation occurring at very low glucose levels\n- Coma: End-stage neuroglycopenic manifestation indicating profound hypoglycemia\n\n**Next Steps & Clinical Pearls:**\nOther autonomic symptoms: hunger, palpitations, anxiety, pallor, trembling. Neuroglycopenic symptoms: difficulty concentrating, drowsiness, weakness, visual changes, slurred speech. Hypoglycemia unawareness (loss of autonomic warning symptoms) develops with recurrent hypoglycemia and is dangerous.\n\n**Variations & Exam Traps:**\nWhipple's triad confirms hypoglycemia: (1) symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, (2) low plasma glucose at time of symptoms, (3) relief of symptoms with glucose administration. Beta-blockers can mask autonomic symptoms except sweating."

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is essential for fetal renal development.\n\nCorrect Answer Explained:\nLisinopril is an ACE inhibitor. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are strictly contraindicated in pregnancy (Category D/X). They are associated with fetal renal dysgenesis, oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and skull ossification defects. Even in the second/third trimester, they cause fetal renal failure.\n\nWhy Other Options Are Wrong:\n- Labetalol: A non-selective beta-blocker with alpha-1 blocking activity. It is a first-line agent for HTN in pregnancy.\n- Methyldopa: An alpha-2 agonist. It has the longest safety track record in pregnancy and is a preferred first-line agent for chronic management.\n- Nifedipine: A calcium channel blocker.
