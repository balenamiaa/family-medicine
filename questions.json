            "explanation": "### Core Concept\nFor infants aged **0–6 months**, the gold standard is **exclusive breastfeeding**. This means breast milk is the sole source of nutrition and hydration.\n\n### Correct Answer Explained\nThe recommendation is to breastfeed as often as the child wants (on demand), both day and night, amounting to at least **8 times in 24 hours**. No other foods or fluids (including water) should be given before 6 months.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- **Cereals at 4 months:** Complementary feeding should start at **6 months**. Early introduction increases the risk of infection and allergies.\n- **Water:** Breast milk contains sufficient water even in hot climates. Supplementing water can introduce pathogens and decrease the infant's intake of nutrient-rich breast milk.\n- **Fruit juices:** Not recommended for infants under 1 year (and definitely not under 6 months) as they displace breast milk and offer no nutritional advantage."
